Many were written in highschool as I was teaching myself the language, I plan on updating and improving them one by one.
I am currently updating and improving ballhoop.

So that was a lie^ lol

For more up to date show of 'skill' view hackathon repo, or for various languages and well commented / structured code view my Academic repo.
