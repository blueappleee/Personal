This includes any programs I have made that are either large enough that they showcase skill or have some practical value but not enough to have its own repo.
This does not contain many of the small programs created while learning languages, just for fun, or to solve a very specific practical problem (ex stock tracking on a single item).

Much of this was created in years ago highschool and is uncommented so proceed at your own risk :)
